# AfterGPT

**AfterGPT** is an iOS app that helps users improve their English by reviewing conversations they've had with GPT.

## Overview

AfterGPT allows users to engage in natural English conversations with GPT. Once the conversation ends, the app analyzes the chat and highlights:

- English mistakes made during the conversation  
- Corrections and suggested improvements  
- Grammar and phrasing tips

## How It Works

1. The user has a conversation in the official ChatGPT app  
2. After the conversation, the user taps “Share” and copies the shared chat URL  
3. The user pastes the URL into the AfterGPT app  
4. AfterGPT retrieves the chat content and analyzes it  
5. Mistakes, corrections, and suggestions are displayed clearly for review and learning
